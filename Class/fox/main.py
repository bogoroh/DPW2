		red_panda.habitat = "Red pandas live in temperate climates in deciduous and coniferous forests. There is usually an understory of bamboo and hollow trees. The average temperature is 10 to 25 degrees Celsius, and the average annual rainfall is 350 centimeters."
		red_panda.geolocation = "Red pandas are found throughout the Himalayan mountains between 2,200 and 4,800 meters in elevation in northern Burma, Nepal, Sikkim region of India, and the districts of western Sichuan and Yunnan in China. Their geographic range is bounded in the north by the Namlung Valley in the Mugo District and the Lake Rara region of northern Nepal, in the south by the Liakiang Range of western Yunnan, and the northern and eastern boundary is the upper Min Valley of western Sichuan."

		great_auk.habitat = "In recorded history, great auks were found breeding only on isolated, rocky islands in the North Atlantic. They foraged in the open ocean when not breeding."
		great_auk.geolocation = "The last great auk was seen in 1852 off the Newfoundland Banks. They were extinct in the western Atlantic before 1800 and persisted a bit longer in some parts of the eastern Atlantic and off the coast of Iceland. They lived and bred on scattered, offshore islands in the northern Atlantic in recorded history, although it is possible they once occurred on continental coastlines but were extirpated from those areas earlier. They were found from Canada, Greenland, and Iceland to the British Isles and Scandinavia. Colonies in the western Atlantic may have been less numerous than in the eastern Atlantic. Archeological records indicate they once occurred as far south as southern Spain and New England in the United States, Pleistocene records indicate great auks occurred as far south as Italy and other parts of the Mediterranean. Great auks became extinct before any natural history studies were conducted, so little is known about their lives except for a few studies of lone, captive birds and the casual records of mariners."

		leopard_cat.alifespan = "In the wild, leopard cats have an average lifespan of about 4 years, and have been known to live up to 20 years in captivity. The lifespan of captive individuals varies greatly as individuals may die from the stress of transport. When leopard cats are released into non-native environments by breeders, they usually die not long after."
		leopard_cat.habitat = "Prionailurus bengalensis is found in tropical and temperate forests, coniferous forests, shrub land habitat, and grasslands. Its distribution is limited to areas with less than 10 cm of snow annually, and it is not found in steppe or arid climates. Prionailurus bengalensis has a fairly diverse diet and is able to find food in most habitats. It seems relatively impervious to human disturbance as populations in secondary growth and disturbed areas are stable and it is often found near agricultural fields and rural settlements. Prionailurus bengalensis is an exceptional swimmer, possibly explaining its distribution on islands, and is intolerant of temperatures above 35 C, possibly explaining its absence from central India. It is capable of living at higher elevations (i.e., 3000 m) with minimal snow fall."
		leopard_cat.geolocation = "Prionailurus bengalensis is one of the most widespread carnivore species in Asia, and can be found throughout most of southern Asia. Prionailurus bengalensis occupies eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, northern and coastal India, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Borneo, Nepal, Korea, Cambodia, parts of the Philippines, and Eastern China. Prionailurus bengalensis has been divided into a number of subspecies over its range that differ in coloration, pelage, body length, and reproductive cycles."
